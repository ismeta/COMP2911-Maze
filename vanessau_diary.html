=============
First meeting.
- We decided on procedural maze generation using depth-first search (easily extensible to whatever size is wanted)
- Extra features: multiplayer, boosts, and wormholes (i.e., teleport user to another square).
- Should we allow window resizing? We'll decide later.
- Storyboard was sketched out.
- Help page will be done in HTML - allows for nicer looking help page.
- Rough UML sketch drawn out:

- Roles delegated:
-- Davina: GUI flow, help page
-- Vanessa: DFS maze generation, incl. boost generation
-- Oliver: Player control

=============
Attempted to write up some of the Maze interface, but this was difficult without knowing what everyone else thought they'd require so I decided to wait until our next meeting or conversation.
