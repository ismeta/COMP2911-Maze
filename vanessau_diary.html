=============
First meeting.
- We decided on procedural maze generation using depth-first search (easily extensible to whatever size is wanted)
- Extra features: multiplayer, boosts, and wormholes (i.e., teleport user to another square).
- Should we allow window resizing? We'll decide later.
- Storyboard was sketched out.
- Help page will be done in HTML - allows for nicer looking help page.
- Rough UML sketch drawn out:

-- Davina: GUI flow, help page
-- Vanessa: DFS maze generation, incl. boost generation
-- Oliver: Player control
